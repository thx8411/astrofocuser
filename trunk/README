===================================================

1. Presentation

   astrofocuser is a very simple tool written with
Qt 4.5 to help star focusing in astrophotogaphy. This
tool applies an FWHM by transparency on the background
window.

2. Requirements

   astrofocuser just needs the standard Qt 4.5 libraries
to work, on a modern windowed operating system, with a
compositing window manager.

3. Usage

   Just launch astrofocuser, and place the window on the
area to exploit. Astrofocuser will then display the area
FWHM in yellow

4. Build from sources

   You will need a cmake, make, a c++ compiler with all
the c++ standard libraries, and the developpement version
of the Qt 4.5 (or above) libraries. You will also need the
developpement version of the libx11 composite extensions.

   To build from source use :

   >gzip -d astrofocuser_?.?.?_src.tar.gz
   >tar -xvf astrofocuser_?.?.?_src.tar
   >mkdir astrofocuser-build
   >cd astrofocuser-build
   >cmake ../astrofocuser_?.?.?_src/
   >make
   >sudo make install


PS : on some OS (like ubuntu 10.04 LTS) , you will have
to activate the special visual effects to get the 
astrofocuser transparency working. Anyway, you will need
a compositing window manager to get astrofocuser working.
